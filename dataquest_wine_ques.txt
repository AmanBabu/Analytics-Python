Create an empty dictionary called totals.
Select only the rows in world_alcohol that match a given year. Assign the result to year.
Loop through a list of countries. For each country:
	Select only the rows from year that match the given country.
	Assign the result to country_consumption.
	Extract the fifth column from country_consumption.
	Replace any empty string values in the column with the string 0.
	Convert the column to the float data type.
	Find the sum of the column.
	Add the sum to the totals dictionary, with the country name as the key.
After the code executes, you'll have a dictionary containing all of the country names as keys, with the associated alcohol consumption totals as the values.
